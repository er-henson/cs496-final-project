# Install and Run Instructions
To run this project, you will need Node and NPM
Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
The Node installer should also install NPM

To install the necessary packages:
 * Open a console window to the project folder
 * Type `npm install` and wait for all packages for the server to install
 * `cd` into the `my-app` folder
 * Type `npm install` again to download React and other necessary packages

To run the server:
 * Open a console window to the project folder
 * Type `node ProjectServer.js`
 * If you see the text `Server running in localhost:4000`, the server is working properly and listening for requests

To run the React project:
 * Open a separate console window to the `my-app` folder
 * Type `npm start`
 * A browser window should shortly open up displaying the website in React on `localhost:3000`


Note that for the frontend and backend to work together properly, the `.env` file is required. It is not included in this repository for security reasons.
